Extracker is a robust PHP application engineered without frameworks to demonstrate mastery of core programming concepts. It features a custom architecture where business logic is loosely coupled and encapsulated in a generic `TripManager` class, ensuring a clean separation of concerns. Database interactions utilize PDO with full transaction support for atomic operations, essentially managing data consistency across multiple related tables during complex trip saves.

Original technical features include dynamic `do-while` loops for precise aggregate calculations and efficient `switch` control structures for page routing. The application strictly enforces strong typing and utilizes PHP 8 features. On the frontend, real-time GPS tracking is manually implemented via the Geolocation API and AJAX, bypassing external libraries. Security is reinforced through a centralized `Queries` repository and prepared statements, delivering a secure, production-ready system built entirely on native code.
