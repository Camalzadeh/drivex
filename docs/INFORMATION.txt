Extracker is a custom-built PHP application designed to manage and analyze driving data without relying on external frameworks. The system implements a Service-Repository pattern (TripService, DrivingSessionRepository) to handle business logic and data access, ensuring a clean separation of concerns. It operates on a Controller-Router architecture (TripController, router.php) to dispatch requests efficiently.

Data reliability is guaranteed using database transactions to save trips, routes, and environmental conditions simultaneously, ensuring that no data is lost during the saving process. The application utilizes a MVC-like structure with separated Views (html_views/) for a maintainable codebase.

The application features advanced dashboard analytics powered by complex SQL queries. It includes Production-Grade Error Handling via a centralized bootstrap mechanism and Robust Data Validation logic on both client and server sides to ensure data integrity. On the client side, it implements real-time tracking using JavaScript and the Geolocation API. This combination of a strict back-end structure, dynamic front-end logic, and security best practices demonstrates a solid grasp of full-stack development principles.
