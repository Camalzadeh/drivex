Extracker is a custom-built PHP application designed to manage and analyze driving data without relying on external frameworks. The system uses a modular `TripManager` class to handle business logic, effectively separating data processing from the user interface. It ensures data reliability by using database transactions to save trips, routes, and environmental conditions simultaneously, ensuring that no data is lost during the saving process.

The application features advanced dashboard analytics powered by complex SQL queries that join multiple tables to provide a comprehensive view of driving habits. On the client side, it implements a real-time tracking feature using JavaScript and the Geolocation API, calculating distances manually with the Haversine formula before syncing with the server. This combination of a strict back-end structure and dynamic front-end logic demonstrates a solid grasp of full-stack development principles and secure coding practices.
